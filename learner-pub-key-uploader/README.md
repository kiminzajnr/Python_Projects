#### Description
Currently the intranet does not "Sniff" changes in learner's public key in their intranet profile. This "adds" that functionality by helping them upload new public keys any time without the need to ask for new servers, redo projects or reconfigure their servers. 

#### A typical problem this would solve

###### Problem:  

`My sandbox that has private key has crushed and am getting this email "Error: No such container:   569046093b164634feead0c288ba9054c3c5edadda4f67e7e79ef0b07b6dace7"
