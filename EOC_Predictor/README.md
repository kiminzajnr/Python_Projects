# End of civilization predictor
*Note, This Is Entirely Fictional*

## Overview

The End of Civilization Predictor is a Python script that simulates various factors contributing to the potential end of civilization. It provides a probability-based simulation, allowing users to customize the duration of the simulation and receive warnings if the probability of civilization ending is high.

## Features

- Simulates the impact of factors such as climate change, overpopulation, probability of war, deadly pathogens, and technological catastrophes.
- Provides a customizable simulation duration.
- Displays warnings if the probability of civilization ending is high.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/kiminzajnr/Python_Mini_Projects.git
   cd end-of-civilization-predictor
2. Run the script:
    ```
    python end_of_civilization.py
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to customize the simulation.

## Factors and Probabilities
The simulation considers the following factors and their probabilities:

- Climate Change: 30%
- Overpopulation: 20%
- Probability of War: 25%
- Deadly Pathogens: 15%
- Technological Catastrophe: 10

## Customization
You can customize the simulation by entering the number of years you want to simulate. The script will then simulate the impact of factors over the specified duration.

## Warning
If the overall probability of civilization ending is higher than 50%, the script displays a warning, suggesting users take necessary precautions.
